                    <p style="text-indent: 5%">Rutgers is a place that encourages free, open, and civil discussion, debate, and exploration of different ideas and viewpoints – a place where we strive to teach students how to think, not what to think. To excel in teaching, research, and service requires that we engage in genuine curiosity and commit ourselves to understanding one another—even around the most difficult and divisive topics. That is intrinsic to our mission.</p>

                    <p style="text-indent: 5%">Rutgers is committed to driving inclusive access for students to Rutgers with an aspiration to be the national model for outstanding academic programs, social mobility and educational equity with purposeful and timely degree completion, career preparation and lifelong learning.</p>

                    <p style="text-indent: 5%">Rutgers believes in building a university culture committed to respect for one another and working together to embody, reflect and appreciate the complexity of all our parts, and we believe in enabling active citizenship, recognizing we all have a role in sustaining our democracy and engaging fully in the growing diversity of our state and country. We endeavor to instill in our students a commitment to community through service and experiences that contribute to a greater understanding of themselves and others, support their whole person while students at Rutgers and provide meaningful engagement post-graduation.</p>
